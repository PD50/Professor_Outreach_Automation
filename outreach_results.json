I'm studying Biomedical Engineering with a double major in Engineering Physics and a minor in Economics. I'm currently in the top 5% of my class, with a CGPA of 8.90/10 (which is about a 9.0/10 equivalent). I'm writing to you because I'm really interested in the possibility of joining your research group at the University of Oxford for a semester-long internship, ideally from January to April 2026.\n\nI'm especially fascinated by your research on how gene regulatory mechanisms mediate hormone responses, and how that leads to new ways to treat metabolic and inflammatory diseases like diabetes and asthma. The way you combine genome-wide techniques with preclinical models really clicks with my own interest in using computational methods to understand and tackle complex biological challenges. I was particularly impressed by your publication on the cistromic reprogramming of the diurnal glucocorticoid hormone response by high-fat diet – it really highlights the importance of gene regulation in metabolic disorders.\n\nMy academic background and research experience have given me some skills that I think would be useful in your research. I have a solid foundation in biomedical imaging, machine learning, and data analysis, which I've built through my coursework and projects. For example, I developed a deep learning model for automatically segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans, and it achieved a 92% Dice similarity coefficient. I also completed a remote research internship at the DISP Lab, INSA Lyon, where I focused on medical image annotation for fundus and angiography datasets. There, I came up with a semi-supervised image annotation approach that cut down manual annotation time by 40% and improved accuracy from 75% to 90%. I'm also proficient in Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), computer vision, and medical image processing.\n\nThanks so much for considering my application!
